title = Musical scales experiment (headphones required, Chrome browser, 15 minutes)
description = This is a music listening experiment, but no musical expertise is required to take part. You will listen to different melodies, and you will be asked to rate them. We use a dynamic payment scheme which means you get paid in proportion to how far you make it through the experiment.

# Set recruitment config manually in the Prolific dashboard:
# - USA, UK, Canada, Mexico
# - no mobile or tablet
# - yes audio

# Because experiment max time was automatically set to 13 minutes,
# we then increased estimated time to 3 minutes in Prolific,
# and increased the base reward to 0.50.
