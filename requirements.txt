# Example pinning a particular version of Dallinger

# Note that caching means that, if you're pinning to a particular branch,
# then subsequent updates to that branch won't necessarily be incorporated into the Docker image.
# If you want to ensure that you have the latest version of the branch, it's best to pin
# to a particular commit.
